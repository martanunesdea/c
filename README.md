# c
Going back to basics with 30 days of programming in C. Starting off with the most elementary data structures and algorithms, then moving on to scheduler programs and cryptography!

## Repository structure
To perserve my sanity and follow a certain order, I'm currently following Skienna's "The Algorithm Design Manual" and Sedgwick's "Algorithms in C". Since the code introduced in the books is provided as loose code blocks, I have organised each topic in its own source file, with a corresponding header file so it can be ported to future algorithm implementations.
1. Data Structures
This folder stores the implementations of the most common data structures: arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables and trees. The folder of trees comprises binary search trees, balanced BSTs and heaps.
2. Sorting
This folder contains a few popular sorting algorithms (mergesort, quicksort, etc.). 
3. Searching
This folder contains common search algorithms (sequential search, binary search, etc).
3. Graph algorithms
This folder contains the implementation of adjacency matrices and adjacency lists in a single file called "graphs". Some other helper programs include: breadth-first search, depth-first search, minimum spanning trees algorithms (Prim's and Kruskal's) and shortest path algoritms (Dijkstra's). 
4. String Processing
Will shortly be added. 


Feel free to pull this repository and use it for your own practice, or to edit and contribute with additional implementations.
