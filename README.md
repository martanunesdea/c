# c
Going back to basics with 30 days of programming in C. Starting off with the most elementary data structures and algorithms, then moving on to scheduler programs and cryptography!

## Repository structure
To perserve my sanity and follow a certain order, I'm currently following Skienna's "The Algorithm Design Manual" and Sedgwick's "Algorithms in C". Since the code introduced in the books is provided as loose code blocks, I have organised each topic in its own source file, with a corresponding header file so it can be ported to future algorithm implementations.
1. Data Structures
This folder stores the implementations of the most common data structures: arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables and trees. The folder of trees comprises binary search trees, balanced BSTs and heaps.
2. Sorting and searching
This folder contains a few popular sorting and searching algorithms (mergesort, quicksort and binary search). 
3. Graphs
This folder contains the implementation of adjacency matrices and adjacency lists in a single file, along with BFS and DFS implementations.
4. Dynamic Programming
Will shortly be added. 


Feel free to pull this repository for your own practice, and you're more than welcome to contribute with your own implementations.
