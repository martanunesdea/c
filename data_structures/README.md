# Data Structures
The following directory is organised in the following way:
- Array based: Includes implementations of the elementary data structures (arrays, lists, stacks and queues) using an array implementation. In other words, it sets a predetermine maximum value of the data structure and the data items are inserted, retrieved and searched based on the item index.
- Linked list based: The same elementary data structures (except arrays) using a pointer-centric, or linked list implementation. In other words, there is not predetermined maximum value given to the data structure, it has no physical bounds other than the computer's allocated memory. However, there is an implicit neccesary traversing step for certain type of operations (e.g. search, deletion).
- Hash tables: The concept of a hash table is distinguished from arrays, lists, stacks and queues and placed in a different directory. At the moment, the hash table is implemented through the array notation. 
- Trees: This includes binary search trees, balancing binary search trees and heaps.
