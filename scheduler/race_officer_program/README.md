# Race Officer Program

When running the program on command line, the user is given three options:
## Option A:
To generate the possible race combinations following a Round Robin fashion (every team plays against each team once). 
This is done by reading the team names in the file "teams.txt". 
The output from calculating the different race combinations is saved to "races.csv". 
This program was designed to be combined with a UI, hence the fixed file names. 
The output file is a CSV to accomodate the possibility for editing fields, etc.
Ideally, the resulting schedule would be organised by the number of boats available.

## Option B:
To add in the results of one race to the existing "races" document.
This was designed to accomodate adding other details into the document (e.g. boat positions, DNF/DNS, capsized, etc.).

## Option C:
To add in several the results of more than one race.

## Option D:
Not implemented yet but it would be good to create a schedule for a team racing event in the format of random pairs.
